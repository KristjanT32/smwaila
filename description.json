   "description" : "Introducing SM: WAILA - the Scrap Mechanic mod to tell you exactly what you're looking at!\r\n\r\nSM: WAILA adds a handy hud element that shows info about the object you're looking at. \r\n\r\nVarious configuration options now available via the /smwaila command.\r\n\r\nInspired by the WAILA, Jade and HWYLA Minecraft mods.\r\nCredit: the mod is maintained by me, but does use some character images from Scrap Mechanic's Fandom page. The mod also uses ModDB as a dependency to show mod names for modded objects - thank you, TechnologicNick, for this awesome mod!",
